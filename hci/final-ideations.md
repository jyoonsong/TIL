## Final Project Ideations

> 아직 광범위

- **Crowd Work** (Computer-supported Cooperative Work)
  - crowdsourcing for complex goals (open-ended)
    - [How Crowdsourcing Workflows Constrain Complex Work](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3134724)
  - Hierarchy
    - 기존 조직에서는 Hierarchy가 부정적인 것으로 결론 남. Crowd Work에서는?
  - Task assignment
    - 현재는 first-come first-served model 혹은 market model
  - Abusing 처리
- **Human-Robot Interaction / Human-AI Collaboration**
  - robot's impact on group dynamics
    - [Robots in the Wild](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3208975)에 따르면 HRI는 1:1 인터랙션에 대한 연구 위주로 이루어져 왔음.
- **Social Computing**
  - 좋아요 is not enough
    - 더 정교한 피드백 시스템을 고안해보자. 선행연구 있는 것으로 앎.

- 웹 기반 실험 인터페이스, 크롤링 등 동반되면 좋을듯.

- *The future of crowd work* (week 2)

  > Future of Crowd Work Processes

  - Workflow : 위

  - Task Assignment 

    : 현재는 first-come/first-served model / a market model

  - Hierarchy 

    : new kinds of hierarchy where workers transition between roles continuously

  - Realtime Crowd Work

    1) scaling up to increased demand for realtime workers

    2) making workers efficient enough to collectively generate results ahead of time deadlines

  - Synchronous Collaboration

    : fast teambuilding and may require the automatic assignment of group members to maximize collective intelligence

  - Quality Control

    : optimize workflows for creativity, innovation, and discovery

  > Future of Crowd Computation

  - Crowds guiding AIs

  - AIs guiding Crowds

    : whether algorithmic management is an improvement over traditional organization management techniques (*Multi-bandit*)

  - Crowdsourcing Platforms

    : flash organizations, inequalities, security concerns

  > Future of Crowd Workers

  - Job Design
  - Reputation and Credentials
  - Motivation and Rewards

  > => 3 design goals

  - Create Career Ladders
  - Improve Task Design through Better Communication
  - Facilitate Learning (김주호 교수님)
