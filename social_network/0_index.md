1. **different types of networks in the real world and why we study them**

   - basic elements of networks
     - such as nodes, edges, and attributes and 
   - different types of networks 
     - such as directed, undirected, weighted, signed, and bipartite
   - how to represent and manipulate networked data 
     - using the NetworkX library

2. **how to analyze the connectivity of a network**

   based on measures of 

   - distance, 
   - reachability, and 
   - redundancy of paths between nodes

   This type of analysis will allow you explore the <u>robustness of a network</u> 

   - when it is exposed to random or targeted attacks 
     - such as the removal of nodes and edges.

3. **ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network** 

   - several different centrality measures)
     - Degree, 
     - Closeness, 
     - Betweenness centrality, 
     - Page Rank, 
     - Hubs and Authorities.

   - assumptions each measure makes
   - the algorithms we can use to compute them, and 
   - the different functions available on NetworkX to measure centrality. 
   - compare the ranking of nodes by centrality produced by the different measures.

4. **the evolution of networks over time**

   - different models that generate networks with realistic features 
     - such as the Preferential Attachment Model and 
     - Small World Networks
   - explore the link prediction problem, 
     - where you will learn useful features that can predict whether a pair of disconnected nodes will be connected in the future
