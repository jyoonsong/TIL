# System-Level I/O

* **Input/Output (I/O)**
  * the process of copying data between main memory and external devices (disk drives, terminals, networks)
  * **input operation**: copies data from an I/O device => to main memory
  * **output operation**: copies data from memory => to a device
* All language run-time systems provide **higher-level facilities** for performing I/O. 
  * ANSI C provides the standard I/O library, 
    * with functions such as printf and scanf that perform buffered I/O. 
  * The C++ language provides similar functionality 
    * with its overloaded << (“put to”) and >> (“get from”) operators.
  * On Linux systems, these higher-level I/O functions are implemented using system-level Unix I/O functions provided by the kernel. 
    * Most of the time, the higher-level I/O functions work quite well and there is no need to use Unix I/O directly. 
    * So why bother learning about Unix I/O?
      1. Understanding Unix I/O will help you understand other systems concepts. (circular dependencies between I/O and other systems ideas)
         - ex) I/O plays a key role in process creation and execution. Conversely, process creation plays a key role in how files are shared by different processes. Thus, to really understand I/O, you need to understand processes, and vice versa. 
      2. Sometimes you have no choice but to use Unix I/O. 
         - ex) the standard I/O library provides no way to access file metadata such as file size or file creation time. 
         - ex) there are problems with the standard I/O library that make it risky to use for network programming.

### 10.1. Unix I/O

* elegant mapping of devices to files
  * A Linux file = a sequence of m bytes
  * All I/O devices (networks, disks, and terminals) are modeled as files
  * All input and output is performed by reading and writing the appropriate files.
  
  => This mapping allows the Linux kernel to export a simple, low-level application interface, known as Unix I/O

* **Unix I/O** enables all input and output to be performed in a uniform and consistent way:

  * opening files

    * application: An application announces its intention to access an I/O device by asking the kernel to **open** the corresponding file. 

    * kernel: The kernel returns a small nonnegative integer, called a **descriptor**, that identifies the file in all subsequent operations on the file. 

      * The kernel keeps track of **all information about the open file.** 
      * The application only keeps track of the **descriptor**.

    * Each process created by a Linux shell begins life with three open files: 

      0. **standard input** (descriptor 0)

      1. **standard output** (descriptor 1)

      2. **standard error** (descriptor 2). 

      => The header file <unistd.h> defines constants STDIN_ FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO, which can be used instead of the explicit descriptor values.

  * changing the current file position

    * The kernel maintains a file position k, initially 0, for each open file.
      * **The file position** is a byte offset from the beginning of a file.
    *  An application can set the current file position k explicitly by performing a **seek** operation.

  * reading and writing files

    * A **read** operation copies n > 0 bytes from a file to memory, 
      * starting at the current file position k and then incrementing k by n. 
      * Given a file with a size of m bytes, performing a read operation when k ≥ m triggers a condition known as **end-of-file (EOF)**, which can be detected by the application. 
        * There is no explicit “EOF character” at the end of a file.
    * Similarly, a **write** operation copies n > 0 bytes from memory to a file, 
      * starting at the current file position k and then updating k

  * closing files

    * application: When an application has finished accessing a file, it informs the kernel by asking it to **close** the file. 
    * kernel: The kernel responds by 
      * freeing the data structures it created when the file was opened and
      * restoring the descriptor to a pool of available descriptors. 
    * When a process terminates for any reason, the kernel closes all open files and frees their memory resources.

### 10.2. Files

* **type** of Linux file: indicates its role in the system
  * **regular file**: contains arbitrary data
    1. **text files**: regular files that contain only ASCII or Unicode characters
      * consist of a sequence of text lines, each terminated by a newline character `\n` == `LF` (ASCII line feed character) == `0x0a` (numeric)
    2. **binary files**: everything else
      * application: **distinguishes**
      * kernel: **no difference**
  * **directory**: a file consisting of an array of **links**, where each link maps a filename to a file, which may be another directory
    * contains at least two entries
      1. `.` (dot): link to the directory itself
      2. `..` (dot-dot): link to the parent directory in the directory hierarchy
    * commands
      * `mkdir` create a directory
      * `ls` view its contents
      * `rmdir` delete a directory
  * **socket**: a file that is used to communicate with another process across a network
* **directory hierarchy**
  * Linux kernel organizes all files in a single directory hierarchy anchored by the **root directory** named `/` (slash)
  * Each file in the system is a direct/indirect descendant of the root directory (O)
* **current working directory**
  * each process has a current working directory
  * identifies its current location in the directory hierarchy
  * command
    * `cd`: change the shell's current working directory 
* **pathnames**
  * a string that  specifies locations in the directory hierarchy, consisting of an optional slash followed by a sequence of filenames and separated by slashes
    * absolute pathname: starts with a slash and denotes a path from the root node
    * relative pathname: starts with a filename and denotes a path from the current working directory

### 10.3. Opening and Closing Files

* `open` function

  * a process opens an existing file or creates a new file by calling the open function

    ```c
    int open (char *filename, int flags, mode_t mode) {
      ...
      return: new file descriptor if OK, -1 on error
    }
    ```

    * converts a **filename** to a file descriptor and returns the descriptor number

      * the descriptor returned is always **the smallest descriptor that is not currently open in the process**

        => the first call to `open` returns descriptor 3 (0, 1, 2 are assigned to open descriptors)

        ```c
        int main() {
          int fd1, fd2;
          fd1 = Open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, O); // fd1 = 3
          Close(fd1); // frees up descriptor 3
          fd2 = Open("baz.txt", O_RDONLY, O); // fd2 = 3
          printf("fd2 = %d\n", fd2); // fd2 = 3
          exit(0);
        }
        ```

        

    * The **flags** arguments indicate how the process intends to access the file

      1. **O_RDONLY**: reading only
      2. **O_WRONLY**: writing only
      3. **O_RDWR**: reading & writing

      ex) `fd = Open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, O); `

      bit masks that provide additional instructions for writing

      1. **O_CREATE**: if the file doesn't exist, then create a truncated (empty) version
      2. **O_TRUNC**: if the file already exists, truncate it
      3. **O_APPEND**: before write operation, set the file position to the end of the file

      ex) `fd = Open("foo.txt", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND, O);`

    - **mode** argument specifies the access permission bits of new files

      - The symbolic names for these bits: 

        - ex) **S_IRUSR**: user (owner) can read this file

      - each process has a **umask** that is set by calling the umask function

        - when a process creates a new file by calling the open function with some mode argument, the access permission bits of the file are set to **mode & ~umask**

          ```c
          umask(DEF_UMASK);
          fd = Open("foo.txt", O_CREATE|O_TRUNC|O_WRONLY, DEF_MODE);
          // 결과: DEF_MODE에서 DEF_UMASK를 뺀 권한이 주어지게 됨
          ```

* `close` function

  * a process closes an open file by calling the close function

    ```c
    int close(int fd) {
      return 0 if OK, -1 on error
    };
    ```

    - closing a descriptor that is already closed is an error

### 10.4. Reading and Writing Files

* `read` function

  ```c
  ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t n) {
    return number of bytes read if OK, 0 on EOF, -1 on error
  }
  ```

  * copies at most n bytes from the current file position of descriptor **fd** to memory location **buf**
  * return value
    * -1: error
    * 0: EOF (End of file)
    * number of bytes transferred: OK

* `write` function

  ```c
  ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t n) {
    return number of bytes written if OK, -1 on error
  }
  ```

  - copies at most n bytes from memory location **buf** to the current file position of descriptor **fd**

* example

  ```c
  int main(void) {
  	char c;
    while( Read(STDIN_FILENO, &c, 1) != 0 )
      Write(STDOUT_FILENO, &c, 1);
    exit(0);
  }
  ```

  - uses read and write calls to copy the standard input to the standard output, 1 byte at a time

* short counts

  * when read and write transfer fewer bytes than the application requests
  * **NOT indicate an error**
  * reasons
    1. Encountering EOF on reads
       - reading in 50-byte chunks but only 20 more bytes from the current file position => signal EOF by returning a short count of 0
    2. Reading text lines from a terminal
       - file == associated with a terminal (keyboard, display)
       - read function transfer one text line at a time => short count equal to the size of the text line
    3. Reading and writing network sockets
       - file == a network socket
       - internal buffering constraints and long network delays can cause read and write to return short counts

### 10.10. Standard I/O

- a set of higher-level input and output functions defined in the C language that provides programmers with a higher-level alternative to Unix I/O

- library `libc`

  - `fopen & fclose` opening and closing files
  - `fread & fwrite` reading and writing bytes
  - `fgets & fputs` reading and writing strings
  - `scanf & printf` sophisticated formatted I/O

- models an open file as a **stream**

  - a pointer to a structure of type FILE

  - every ANSI C program begins with three open streams: stdin, stdout, stderr

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    extern FILE *stdin; // standard input (descriptor 0)
    extern FILE *stdout; // standard output (descriptor 1)
    extern FILE *stderr; // standard error (descriptor 2)
    ```

  - an abstraction for a file descriptor and a **stream buffer**

  - purpose: minimize the number of expensive Linux I/O system calls.
